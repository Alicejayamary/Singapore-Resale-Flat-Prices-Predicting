Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction
Welcome to the Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction project! This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating the resale prices of Housing Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and policymakers in the real estate market.

Project Overview
Singapore's housing market is dynamic and multifaceted, with resale flat prices influenced by a variety of factors including location, flat type, and economic conditions. This project focuses on:

Data Collection: Gathering historical resale transaction data from reliable sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure it is suitable for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to identify patterns, trends, and key features influencing flat prices.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Building: Developing and tuning multiple machine learning models to find the best performer.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics and validation techniques.
Prediction: Providing predictions for future resale flat prices based on the developed model.
Key Features
Comprehensive Dataset: Utilizes a robust dataset of historical resale flat transactions.
Multiple Models: Explores a range of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies the most significant factors affecting resale flat prices.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a Streamlit app for interactive predictions and visualizations.
